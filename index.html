EASY HELP
Save Koalas From Possible Extinction!
Loss of koala habitat is the major threat facing koalas today. Since white settlement of Australia, roughly 80% of the koala’s habitat has been destroyed and of what remains, most occurs on privately owned land and almost none is protected. -->

HELP KOALAS
“No Tree... No Me”

It’s not hard to see how we can help.

There are many people who are working very hard to achieve the conservation of the koala and you can join them by visiting www.savethekoala.com.

The only way to save koalas is to save their habitat, the eucalyptus forests where they live, and which they must have to survive. This is what the Australian Koala Foundation is trying to achieve.

But they can't do it alone and they need the help of people like you. You may think that just one person cannot make any difference in helping koalas or in helping our environment generally, but if each person does even one little thing to help, it can add up to a lot of help.-->
